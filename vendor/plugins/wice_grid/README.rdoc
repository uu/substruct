== Intro

WiceGrid is a Rails plugin which builds the call to the ActiveRecord layer for you and creates a table view with the results of the call including:

* paging
* sortable columns
* filtering by multiple columns
* CSV export
* saving queries (<em>considered experimental as of version 0.3</em>)

All working nicely together. Filters are added automatically according to the type of the underlying DB column. Filtering by more than one column at the same time is possible. More than one such grid can appear on a page, and manipulations with one grid do not have any impact on the other.

WiceGrid does not take a collection as an input, it works directly with ActiveRecord (with the help of <tt>will_paginate[http://github.com/mislav/will_paginate/wikis]</tt>).

WiceGrid does not use AJAX calls to reload itself, instead simple GET requests are used for this, nevertheless, all other page parameters are respected and preserved. WiceGrid views do not contain forms so you can include it in your own forms.


WiceGrid is known to work with MySQL and Postgres.


== Requirements

<tt>will_paginate[http://github.com/mislav/will_paginate/wikis]</tt> version 2.3.2 or newer.

<tt>Prototype[http://www.prototypejs.org]</tt> version 1.5.1 or newer.

== How-To

=== Installation

Run the following command to install the plugin:

  script/plugin install git://github.com/leikind/wice_grid.git

To copy the plugin initializer, icons,  javascripts, and stylesheets to correct location,  run the following command:

   ./script/generate wice_grid_assets

Using ./script/generate to copy assets gives the advantage of collision control - if a file with the same name already
exists at the given location, the script will pause and ask the user about what action to take.

=== Basics

WiceGrid requires prototype.js and effects.js in order to function, so make sure you have <tt><%=javascript_include_tag :defaults %></tt> in your layout template.

To include WiceGrid javascript and stylesheet files to the page use helper +include_wice_grid_assets+ :

  <%= include_wice_grid_assets %>

The simplest example of a WiceGrid for one simple DB table called ApplicationAccount is the following:

Controller:

  @tasks_grid = initialize_grid(Task)

View:

  <%= grid(@tasks_grid) do |g|

    g.column do |task|
      task.id
    end

    g.column  do |task|
      task.title
    end

    g.column do |task|
      task.description
    end

    g.column do |task|
      task.archived? ? 'Yes' : 'No'
    end

    g.column do |task|
      link_to('Edit', edit_task_path(task))
    end
  end -%>

Code <tt>g.column do |task| ... end</tt>
defines everything related to a column in the resulting view table including column names, sorting, filtering, the content of the column cells, etc.
The return value of the block is the table cell content.

In the above view code five columns were defined, all without names, no sorting or filtering is available. Still, pagination becomes active if
the number of all extracted records exceeds the default number of rows per page.

Column names are defined with parameter <tt>:column_name</tt>:

  <%= grid(@tasks_grid) do |g|

    g.column :column_name => 'ID' do |task|
      task.id
    end

    g.column :column_name => 'Title'  do |task|
      task.title
    end

    g.column  :column_name => 'Description' do |task|
      task.description
    end

    g.column  :column_name => 'Archived' do |task|
      task.archived? ? 'Yes' : 'No'
    end

    g.column   do |task|
      link_to('Edit', edit_task_path(task))
    end
  end -%>

To add filtering and ordering, declare to which column in the underlying database table(s) the view column corresponds using
parameter <tt>:attribute_name</tt> :

  <%= grid(@tasks_grid) do |g|

    g.column :column_name => 'ID', :attribute_name => 'id' do |task|
      task.id
    end

    g.column :column_name => 'Title', :attribute_name => 'title'  do |task|
      task.title
    end

    g.column  :column_name => 'Description', :attribute_name => 'description' do |task|
      task.description
    end

    g.column  :column_name => 'Archived', :attribute_name => 'archived' do |task|
      task.archived? ? 'Yes' : 'No'
    end

    g.column   do |task|
      link_to('Edit', edit_task_path(task))
    end
  end -%>

This will  add sorting links and filters for columns +Username+ and +Active+. 
The plugin automatically creates filters according to the type
of the database column. In the above example a text field will be created for column Title (title is a string), 
for column +Archived+ a dropdown filter will be created with options 'Yes', 'No', and '--', and for the integer ID two short text fields are
added which can contain the numeric range (more than, less than).

It is important to remember that <tt>:attribute_name</tt> is the name of the database column, not a model attribute. Of course, all database columns have corresponding model attributes, but not all model attributes map to columns in the same table with the same name.

Read more about available filters in the documentation
for the column method. Read the section about custom dropdown filters for more advanced filters.


For columns like

  g.column :column_name => 'Title', :attribute_name => 'title'  do |task|
    task.title
  end

where the block contains just a call to the same attribute declared by :attribute_name, the block can be omitted:

  <%= grid(@tasks_grid) do |g|

    g.column :column_name => 'ID', :attribute_name => 'id'

    g.column :column_name => 'Title', :attribute_name => 'title'

    g.column  :column_name => 'Description', :attribute_name => 'description'

    g.column  :column_name => 'Archived', :attribute_name => 'archived' do |task|
      task.archived? ? 'Yes' : 'No'
    end

    g.column   do |task|
      link_to('Edit', edit_task_path(task))
    end
  end -%>


In this case +attribute_name+ will be used as the method name to send to the ActiveRecord instance.

If only sorting is needed, we can turn off filters using <tt>:no_filter</tt> :

  g.column :column_name => 'ID', :attribute_name => 'id', :no_filter => true


It is important to understand that it is up to the developer to make sure that the value returned by a column block (the content of a cell) corresponds to the underlying database column specified by  <tt>:attribute_name</tt> (and <tt>:model_class</tt> discussed below).


=== Rendering filter panel

The filter panel can be shown and hidden clicking the icon with binoculars.

The way the filter panel is shown after the page is loaded is controlled via parameter <tt>:show_filters</tt> of the <tt>grid</tt> helper.
Possible values are:

* <tt>:when_filtered</tt> - the filter is shown when the current table is the result of filtering
* <tt>:always</tt> - show the filter always
* <tt>:no</tt> - never show the filter

Example:

  <%= grid(@tasks_grid, :show_filters => :always) do |g|
    ......
  end -%>


=== Initial Ordering

Initializing the grid we can also define the column by which the record will be ordered <em>on the first rendering of the grid</em>, when the user has not set their ordering setting by clicking the column label, and the order direction:

  @tasks_grid = initialize_grid(Task,
    :order => 'tasks.title',
    :order_direction => 'desc'
  )

=== Records Per Page

The number of rows per page is set with <tt>:per_page</tt>:

  @tasks_grid = initialize_grid(Task, :per_page => 40)

=== Conditions

The +initialize_grid+ method supports a <tt>:conditions</tt> parameter which is passed on to the underlying ActiveRecord (via will_paginate), so it can be anything that <tt>:conditions</tt> in <tt>ActiveRecord#find</tt> can be:


  @tasks_grid = initialize_grid(Task,
    :conditions => {:archived => false}
  )

A good example is substituting a common pattern like

  @user_groups = @portal_application.user_groups

with WiceGrid code:

  @user_groups_grid = initialize_grid(UserGroup, :conditions => ['portal_application_id = ?', @portal_application])


=== Queries with join tables

WiceGrid also supports ActiveRecord's <tt>:joins</tt> and <tt>:include</tt>.

  @products_grid = initialize_grid(Product,
    :include => :category,
    :order => 'products.name',
    :per_page => 20)

Note that if we want to order initially by a column from a joined table we have to specify the table and the column name with the sql dot notation, that is, <tt>products.name</tt>

To show columns of joined tables in the view table, the ActiveRecord model class name has to be specified, that corresponds to the joined table:

  <%= grid(@products_grid) do |g|
    g.column :column_name => 'Product Name', :attribute_name => 'name' do |product|  # primary table
      link_to(product.name, product_path(product))
    end

    g.column :column_name => 'Category', :attribute_name => 'name', :model_class => Category |product| # joined table
      product.category.name
    end
  %>
  
Please note that the blockless definition of the column only works with columns from the main table and it won't work with columns with <tt>:model_class</tt>

=== Joined associations referring to the same table

In case there are two joined associations both referring to the same table, ActiveRecord constructs a query where
the second join provides an alias for the joined table. To enable WiceGrid to order and filter by columns belonging to different associations
but originating from the same table, set <tt>:table_alias</tt> to this alias:

Model:

   class Project < ActiveRecord::Base
     belongs_to :customer, :class_name => 'Company'
     belongs_to :supplier, :class_name => 'Company'
   end

Controller:

    @projects_grid = initialize_grid(Project, :include => [:customer, :supplier] )


View:

  <%= grid(@projects_grid, :show_filters => :always) do |g|

    g.column :column_name => 'Project Name', :attribute_name => 'name'

    g.column  :column_name => 'Customer company', :model_class => 'Company', :attribute_name => 'name' do |task|
      task.customer.name if task.customer
    end

    g.column  :column_name => 'Supplier company', :model_class => 'Company', :attribute_name => 'name', :table_alias => ' suppliers_projects' do |task|
      task.supplier.name if task.supplier
    end

  end -%>


=== More than one grid on a page

It is possible to use more that one grid on a page, each with its own state. To do so, you must specify the name of the grid in +initialize_grid+ using
parameter <tt>:name</tt>

The name serves as the base name for HTTP parameters, DOM IDs, etc, so it is important that all grids on a page have different names. The default
name is 'grid'.

The name can only contain alphanumeric characters.

  @projects_grid = initialize_grid(Project, :name => 'g1' )
  @tasks_grid = initialize_grid(Task, :name => 'g2')


=== Custom Ordering

It is possible to change the way results are ordered injecting a piece of SQL code, for example, use 
<tt>ORDER BY INET_ATON(ip_address)</tt> instead of <tt>ORDER BY ip_address</tt>.

To do so, provide parameter <tt>:custom_order</tt> in the initialization of the grid with a hash where keys are fully qualified names
of database columns, and values the required chunks of SQL to use in the ORDER BY clause.

For example:


  @hosts_grid = initialize_grid(Host,
    :custom_order => {
      'hosts.ip_address' => 'INET_ATON(hosts.ip_address)'
    })


It is possible to use the '?' character instead of the name of the column in the hash value:

    @hosts_grid = initialize_grid(Host,
      :custom_order => {
        'hosts.ip_address' => 'INET_ATON( ? )'
      })

Values can also be Proc objects. The parameter supplied to such a Proc object is the name of the column:

      @hosts_grid = initialize_grid(Host,
        :custom_order => {
          'hosts.ip_address' => lambda{|f| "INET_ATON( #{f} )"}
        })


=== Custom dropdown filters

It is possible to construct custom dropdown filters. Depending on the value of <tt>column</tt> parameter<tt>:custom_filter</tt> different
modes are available:


==== Array of two-element arrays or a hash

An array of two-element arrays or a hash are semantically identical ways of creating a custom filter.

Every first item of the two-element array is used for the label of the select option while the second element is the value of the select option. In case of a hash the keys become the labels of the generated dropdown list, while the values will be values of options of the dropdown list:

  g.column :column_name => 'Status', :attribute_name => 'status', 
           :custom_filter => {'Development' => 'development', 'Testing' => 'testing', 'Production' => 'production'}

  g.column :column_name => 'Status', :attribute_name => 'status', 
          :custom_filter => [['Development', 'development'], ['Testing', 'testing'], ['Production', 'production']]

It is also possible to submit a array of strings or numbers, in this case every item will be used both as the value of the select option and as its label:

  g.column :column_name => 'Status', :attribute_name => 'status', 
           :custom_filter => ['development', 'testing', 'production']


==== :auto

<tt>:auto</tt> - a powerful option which populates the dropdown list with all unique values of the column specified by
<tt>:attribute_name</tt> and <tt>:model_class</tt>.

  g.column :column_name => 'Status', :attribute_name => 'status', 
           :custom_filter => ['development', 'testing', 'production']

Note that in the above example all names of all possible categories will appear even if they don't appear in the current resultset.
To only show those which do appear in the resutset, use an array of symbol messages (see section 'An array of symbols').


==== Custom filters and associations (joined tables)

In most cases custom fields are required for one-to-many and many-to-many associations. 

To correctly build a filter condition foreign keys have to be matched.

For example, if there is a column:

  g.column :column_name => 'Project Name', :attribute_name => 'name', :model_class => 'Project' do |task|
    task.project.name if task.project
  end

adding <tt>:custom_filter</tt> like this:

  g.column :column_name => 'Project Name', :attribute_name => 'name', :model_class => 'Project', 
           :custom_filter => Project.find(:all).map{|pr| [pr.name, pr.name]} do |task|
    task.project.name if task.project
  end

is bad style and can fail, because the resulting condition will compare the name of the project, <tt>projects.name</tt> to a string,
and in some databases it is possible that different  records (projects in our example) have the same name.

To use filter with foreign keys, we have to change the declaration of the column from <tt>projects.name</tt>, to 
<tt>tasks.project_id</tt>, and build the dropdown with foreign keys as values:


  g.column :column_name => 'Project Name', :attribute_name => 'tasks.project_id',
           :custom_filter => Project.find(:all).map{|pr| [pr.id, pr.name]} do |task|
    task.project.name if task.project
  end

However, this will break the ordering of the column - the column will be ordered by the integer foreign key. To fix this,
we can override the ordering using <tt>:custom_order</tt>:

  @tasks_grid = initialize_grid(Task,
    :include => :project,
    :custom_order => {
      'tasks.project_id' => 'projects.name'
    }
  )


==== Any other symbol (method name) or an array of symbols (method names)


For one symbol (different from <tt>:auto</tt>) the dropdown list is populated by all unique values returned by the method with this name
sent to <em>all</em> ActiveRecord objects throughout all pages.

The conditions set up by the user are ignored, that is, the records used are all those found on all pages without any filters active.

For an array of symbols, the first method name is sent to the ActiveRecord
object if it responds to this method, the second method name is sent to the
returned value unless it is +nil+, and so on. In other words, a single symbol mode is the
same as an array of symbols where the array contains just one element.

  g.column :column_name => 'Version', :attribute_name => 'expected_version_id', :custom_filter => [:expected_version, :to_option] do |task|
    task.expected_version.name if task.expected_version
  end


There are two important differences from <tt>:auto</tt>:

1. The  method does not have to be a field in the result set, it is just some  value computed in the method after the database call and ActiveRecord instantiation.
2. Filtering by any option of such a custom filter will bring a non-empty list, unlike with <tt>:auto</tt>.


This mode has one major drawback - this mode requires an additional query without +offset+ and +limit+ clauses to instantiate _all_
ActiveRecord objects, and performance-wise it brings all the advantages of pagination to nothing.  Thus, memory- and performance-wise this can be really bad for some queries and tables and should be used with care.


If the final method returns a atomic value like a string or an integer, it is used for both the value and the label of the select option element:

  <option value="returned value">returned value</option>

However, if the retuned value is a two element array, the first element is used for the option label and the second - for the value.

Typically, a model method like the following:

  def to_option
    [name, id]
  end
  
together with 

  :custom_filter => :to_option
  
would do the trick:

  <option value="id">name</option>

Alternatively, a hash with the single key-value pair can be used, where the key will be used for the label, and the key - for the value:

  def to_option
    {name => id}
  end


==== Special treatment of values 'null' and 'not null'

Values 'null' and 'not null' in a generated custom filter are treated specially, as SQL +null+ statement and not as strings.
Value 'null' is transformed into SQL condition <tt>IS NULL</tt>, and 'not null' into <tt>IS NOT NULL</tt>
  
Thus, if in a filter defined by
     :custom_filter => {'No' => 'null', 'Yes' => 'not null', '1' => 1, '2' => '2', '3' => '3'}
values '1', '2' and 'No' are selected (in a multi-select mode),  this will result in the following SQL:
  
    ( table.field IN ( '1', '2' ) OR table.field IS NULL )


=== Defaults

Default values like  can be  changed in <tt>config/initializers/wice_grid_config.rb</tt>, as well grid labels and paths to some images.



=== Submit/Reset buttons
View helper +submit_grid_javascript+ returns javascript which applies current filters.
View helper +reset_grid_javascript+ returns javascript which resets the grid, clearing the state of filters. 
This allows to create your own Submit and Reset buttons anywhere on the page with the help of +button_to_function+:

  <%= button_to_function "Submit", submit_grid_javascript(@grid) %>
  <%= button_to_function "Reset",  reset_grid_javascript(@grid) %>
  
To complement this feature there are two parameters in the +grid+ helper <tt>:hide_submit_button</tt> and <tt>:hide_reset_button</tt> which 
hide default buttons in the grid if set to true.




=== Styling the grid

==== Predefined css classes used by the grid

+td+ tags are assigned two styles automatically - +sorted+ if the column is the one by which the grid is ordered, 
and +active_filter+ if the column's filter is on.

Odd and even +tr+ tags are assigned styles +odd+ and +even+, correspondingly.

For other classes see <tt>wice_grid.css</tt>. Feel free to customize it according to your needs.

==== Adding classes and styles

The +grid+ helper accepts parameter <tt>:table_html_attrs</tt> which is a hash of HTML
attributes for the table tag. 

Another +grid+ parameter is <tt>header_tr_html_attrs</tt> which is a hash of HTML attributes to be added to the first +tr+ tag (or two first +tr+'s if the filter row is present).

<tt>:td_html_attrs</tt> is a parameter for the +column+ method setting HTML attributes of +td+ tags for a certain column.

==== Adding classes and styles dynamically

WiceGrid offers ways to dynamically add classes and styles to +TR+ and +TD+ based on the current ActiveRecord instance.


For <tt><TD></tt>, let the +column+ return an array where the first item is the usual
string output whole the second is a hash of HTML attributes to be added for the <tt><td></tt> tag of the current cell:

  g.column  do |portal_application|
    css_class = portal_application.public? ? 'public' : 'private'
    [portal_application.name, {:class => css_class}]
  end

For adding classes/styles to <tt><TR></tt> use special clause  +row_attributes+ , similar to +column+, only returning a hash:

    <%= grid(@versions_grid) do |g|
      g.row_attributes do |version|
        if version.in_production?
          {:style => 'background-color: rgb(255, 255, 204);'}
        end
      end

      g.column{|version| ... }
      g.column{|version| ... }
    end  -%>

Naturally, there can be only one +row_attributes+ definition for a WiceGrid instance.

Various classes do not overwrite each other, instead, they are concatenated.

WiceGrid icons are in directory <tt>public/images/icons/grid/</tt>.


=== Adding rows to the grid

It is possible to add your own handcrafted HTML after and/or before each grid row. This works similar to +row_attributes+, by adding blocks +after_row+ and +before_row+:

  <%= grid(@tasks_grid) do |g|
    g.before_row do |task|
      if task.active?
        "<tr><td colspan=\"10\">Custom line for #{t.name}</td></tr>"  # this would add a row 
                                                                      # before every active task row
      else
        nil
      end
    end
    .......
  end %>

It is up for the developer to return the correct HTML code, or return +nil+ if no row is needed for this record. Naturally, there is only one +before_row+  definition and one +after_row+  definition for a WiceGrid instance.

A real life example might be some enterprisy  tables inside a table.

=== Rendering a grid without records

If the grid does not contain any records to show, it is possible show some alternative view instead of an empty grid. Bear in mind that if the user 
sets up the filters in such a way that the selection of records is empty, this will still render the grid and it will be possible to
reset the grid clicking on the Reset button. Thus, this only works if the initial number of records is 0.
  
    <%= grid(@grid) do |g|
    
      g.blank_slate  do
        "There are no records"
      end
  
      g.column  do |product|
         ...
      end
     end  -%>
  
There are two alternative ways to do the same, submitting a string to +blank_slate+:
  
  g.blank_slate "some text to be rendered"
  
Or a partial:
  
  g.blank_slate :partial => "partial_name"


=== ERB mode

The view helper can function in two different modes. These are defined by its +erb_mode+ parameter.
By default (<tt>:erb_mode => false</tt>) the view helper is a simple helper surrounded by <tt><%=</tt> and <tt>%></tt>, like in all examples
above.


The second mode (<tt>:erb_mode => true</tt>) is called <em>ERB mode</em> and it allows to embed any ERB content inside blocks,
which is basically the style of the
<tt>form_for</tt> helper, only <tt>form_for</tt> takes one block, while inside the <tt>grid</tt> block there are other method calls taking
blocks as parameters:

    <% grid(@countries_grid, :erb_mode => true) do |g| %>

      <% g.column :column_name => 'Name', :attribute_name => 'name' do |country| %>
        <b>Name: <%= link_to(country.name, country_path(country)) %></b>
      <% end %>

      <% g.column :column_name => 'Numeric Code', :attribute_name => 'numeric_code' do |country| %>
        <i>Numeric Code: <%= country.numeric_code %></i>
      <% end %>

    <% end -%>

This mode can be usable if you like to have much HTML code inside cells.

Please remember that in this mode the helper opens with <tt><%</tt> instead of <tt><%=</tt>, similar to <tt>form_for</tt>.

The default value for <tt>:show_filters</tt> can be changed in <tt>config/initializers/wice_grid_config.rb</tt>.


=== Integration of the grid with other forms on page

Imagine that the user should be able to change the behavior of the grid using some other control on the page, and not a grid filter.

For example, on a page showing tasks,
change between 'Show active tasks' to 'Show archived tasks' using a dropdown box.
WiceGrid allows to keep the status of the grid with all the filtering and sorting
using helper +dump_filter_parameters_as_hidden_fields+ which takes a grid object and dumps all current sorting and filtering parameters as
hidden fields. Just include <tt>dump_filter_parameters_as_hidden_fields(@grid)</tt> inside your form, and the newly rendered grid will
keep ordering and filtering.

  <% form_tag('', :method => :get) do %>
    <%= dump_filter_parameters_as_hidden_fields(@tasks_grid) %>
    <%= select_tag 'archived', 
       options_for_select([['View active tasks', 0], ['View archived tasks', 1]], @archived ? 1 : 0), 
      :onchange => 'this.form.submit()' %>
  <% end -%>


=== Javascript Calendar for Date and DateTime Filters.

Standard Rails Date and DateTime helpers are a set of dropdown lists, and while this is practical, displaying two Date or especially DateTime
helpers takes too much space on a page and is in general confusing.

To solve this, WiceGrid includes a second variant of Date/DateTime filters based on a Javascript calendar.

Calendar based helpers are enabled by default, but it's possible to change it in <tt>config/initializers/wice_grid_config.rb</tt>, variable HELPER_STYLE.

The flavor of the date filter can also be changed on per-column basis:

  g.column :column_name => 'Due Date', :attribute_name => 'due_date', :helper_style => :calendar do |task|
    task.due_date.to_s(:short) if task.due_date
  end

  g.column :column_name => 'Updated', :attribute_name => 'updated_at', :helper_style => :standard do |task|
    task.created_at.to_s(:short)
  end

You can change the presentation format of the date changing +DATETIME_FORMAT+ and +DATE_FORMAT+ in 
<tt>config/initializers/wice_grid_config.rb</tt>. Doing
this,  make sure that lamdbas defined in +DATETIME_PARSER+ and +DATE_PARSER+ return  valid DateTime and Date objects. The format
by default is <tt>%Y-%m-%d</tt> for the Date and the date part of DateTime, and DateTime.parse and Date.parse handle it.
Make sure it stays so.


=== Show All Records

It is possible to switch to the All Records mode clicking on link "show all" in the bottom right corner. This functionality should be used
with care. To turn this mode off for all grid instances, change constant +ALLOW_SHOWING_ALL_QUERIES+ in
<tt>config/initializers/wice_grid_config.rb</tt> to
+false+. To do so for a specific grid, use initializer parameter <tt>:allow_showing_all_records</tt>.

Configuration constant +START_SHOWING_WARNING_FROM+ sets the threshold number of all records after which clicking on the
link results in a javascript confirmation dialog.


=== CSV Export

It is possible to export the data displayed on a grid to a CSV file. The dumped data is the current resultset with all the
current filters and sorting applied, only without the pagination constraint (i.e. all pages).

To enable CSV export add parameters +enable_export_to_csv+ and +csv_file_name+ to the initialization of the grid:

  @projects_grid = initialize_grid(Project,
    :include => [:customer, :supplier],
    :name => 'g2',
    :enable_export_to_csv => true,
    :csv_file_name => 'projects'
  )

+csv_file_name+ is the name of the downloaded file. This parameter is optional, if it is missing, the name of the grid is used instead.
The export icon will appear at the bottom right corner of the grid.

Next, each grid view helper should be placed in a partial of its own, requiring it from the master template for the usual flow. There must be no 
HTML or ERB code in this partial except for the grid helper.

By convention the name of such a partial follows the following pattern:

  _GRID_NAME_grid.html.erb

In other words, a grid named +tasks+ is expected to be found in a template called <tt>_tasks_grid.html.erb</tt> (remember that the default name of grids is '+grid+'.)

Next, method +export_grid_if_requested+ should be added to the end of each action containing grids with enabled CSV export.

+export_grid_if_requested+ intercepts CSV export requests and evaluates the partial with the required grid helper.

The naming convention for grid partials can be easily overridden by supplying a hash parameter to +export_grid_if_requested+
where each key is the name of a grid, and the value is the name of the template (like it is specified for +render+, i.e.
without '_' and extensions):


    export_grid_if_requested('g1' => 'tasks_grid', 'g2' => 'projects_grid')

If the request is not a CSV export request, +export_grid_if_requested+ does nothing and returns +false+, if it is a CSV export request,
the method returns +true+.


If the action has no explicit +render+ call, it's OK to just place +export_grid_if_requested+ as the last line of the action:

  def index

    @tasks_grid = initialize_grid(Task,
      :name => 'g1',
      :enable_export_to_csv => true,
      :csv_file_name => 'tasks'
    )

    @projects_grid = initialize_grid(Project,
      :name => 'g2',
      :enable_export_to_csv => true,
      :csv_file_name => 'projects'
    )

    export_grid_if_requested
  end


Otherwise, to avoid double rendering, use the return value of the method to conditionally call your +render+ :


  def index

    ...........

    export_grid_if_requested || render(:action => 'my_template')
  end


It's also possible to supply a block which will be called if no CSV export is requested:

  def index

    ...........

    export_grid_if_requested do
       render(:action => 'my_template')
    end
  end


If a column has to be excluded from the CSV export, 
set +column+ parameter +in_csv+ to +false+:

  g.column  :in_csv => false do |task|
    link_to('Edit', edit_task_path(task))
  end
  
If a column must appear both in HTML and CSV, but with different output,
duplicate the column and use
parameters +in_csv+ and +in_html+ to include one of them to  html output only, the other to CSV only:


  # html version
  g.column :column_name => 'Title', :attribute_name => 'title', :in_csv => false do |task|
    link_to('Edit', edit_task_path(task.title))
  end
  # plain text version
  g.column :column_name => 'Title', :in_html => false do |task|
    task.title
  end

The default field separator in generated CSV is a comma, but it's possible to override this submitting a 
string to the <tt>:enable_export_to_csv</tt> parameter:

  @products_grid = initialize_grid(Product,
    :enable_export_to_csv => ';',
    :csv_file_name => 'products')


=== Detached Filters

It is possible to detach filters and place them anywhere on the page. To do so, use parameter <tt>:detach_with_id</tt> for a column whose filter needs to be detached, with an arbitrary string or a symbol value which will be used later to identify the filter. As soon as there is one column with <tt>:detach_with_id</tt>, the behavior of the +grid+ helper changes - it becomes an <i>initializer</i> of the grid and doesn't output any HTML code. To render the grid, use <tt>grid</tt> for the second time without the block. To render a detached output filter, use helper <tt>grid_filter(grid_object, detached_filter_key)</tt>:

<%= grid(@tasks_grid, :show_filters => :always) do |g|

  g.column :column_name => 'Title', :attribute_name => 'title', :detach_with_id => :title_filter do |task|
    link_to('Edit', edit_task_path(task.title))
  end

  g.column  :column_name => 'Archived', :attribute_name => 'archived', :detach_with_id => :archived_filter do |task|
    task.archived? ? 'Yes' : 'No'
  end

  g.column :column_name => 'Added', :attribute_name => 'created_at', :detach_with_id => :created_at_filter do |task|
    task.created_at.to_s(:short)
  end

end -%>

  <% # rendering filter with key :title_filter %>
  <%= grid_filter @tasks_grid, :title_filter  %>
  
  <% # rendering filter with key :archived_filter %>
  <%= grid_filter @tasks_grid, :archived_filter  %>

  <% # rendering filter with key :created_at_filter %>
  <%= grid_filter @tasks_grid, :created_at_filter  %>

  <% # Rendering the grid body %>
  <%= grid(@tasks_grid) %>

It is important that the grid initializer goes first, the order of +grid_filter+ and the second call to +grid+ is of no importance.

Using custom submit and reset buttons together with <tt>:hide_submit_button => true</tt> and <tt>:hide_reset_button => true</tt> 
allows to completely get rid
of the default filter row and the default icons (see section 'Submit/Reset Buttons').

For CSV export will continue functioning, just make sure the first call to +grid+ is still in the template of its own and 
is inside of <tt><%= %></tt>, because when CSV is requested, the first  +grid+ works in the old fashioned way producing CSV formatted output.

This feature also works with <tt>:erb_mode => true</tt>.

If a column was declared with <tt>:detach_with_id</tt>, but never output with +grid_filter+, filtering the grid in development mode will result
in an warning javascript message and the missing filter will be ignored. There is no such message in production.

==== How Does It Work? (For the interested)

When there is at least one column with <tt>:detach_with_id</tt>, the generated HTML code is stored in a buffer, code for detached filters is stored
in buffers of their own identified by the given IDs, and nothing is returned to the view. 
When the helper is called for the second time, the buffer outputs its content.
In a similar fashion, the +grid_filter+ helper outputs buffers for filters.

=== Compatibility with Rails Asset Caching

Helpers +names_of_wice_grid_stylesheets+ and +names_of_wice_grid_javascripts+ return names of stylesheet and javascript files and can be used with   
+stylesheet_link_tag+ and +javascript_include_tag+ with <tt>:cache => true</tt>. 
Using this trick you have to deal with the parameters correctly, mind that Prototype has to be loaded before WiceGrid javascripts:

  <%= stylesheet_link_tag *(['core',  'modalbox'] + names_of_wice_grid_stylesheets + [ {:cache => true}]) %>
  <%= javascript_include_tag *([:defaults] + names_of_wice_grid_javascripts + [ 'ui', 'swfobject', {:cache => true}]) %>


=== Integration With The Application

If it is needed to retrieve the objects of the current selection that the user has set up using filters, for use outside of WiceGrid,
WiceGrid initialization routine accepts parameter <tt>:after</tt> to setup a callback to a method or a Proc object which will be called
with an object giving access to the selection of objects.

A good example is the following use case:

* User sets up filters to select products
* User clicks the button "Send to customer"
* The system generates a letter to a customer containing descriptions of the products selected by the user.

The code to implement this use case might look the following way:


  def index

    @products_grid = initialize_grid(Product,
      :include => [:category, :vat_code, :labels, :brand],
      :order => 'products.name',
      :after => :process_selection,
      :per_page => 10)

    @user_requests_mail_to_be_sent = user_requests_mail_to_be_sent?()

  end

  def process_selection(wrapper_proc)
    if @user_requests_mail_to_be_sent
      compose_mail(wrapper_proc.call)
    end
  end

The object supplied to the callback is not the list of selected objects but a Proc object that needs to be called to obtain this list.
This is done so to avoid redundant SQL calls each time when the page with the grid is rendered;
the list of objects are objects accessible throughout <i>all pages</i> of the current filtered selection, and can be quite large.
